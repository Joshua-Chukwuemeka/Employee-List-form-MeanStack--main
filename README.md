# Employers Reg Form(MeanStack App)
This is a MEAN Stack Project Showing CRUD Operations Insert Update Delete and Read. It has a form and a table, so when you fill in the form and saves it displays on the table and you can edit the table data and also delete. So this are the basic functionality of the app. In subsequent time I'll modify to take other things.

# How to run it
Do npm install for both the AngularApp and the NodeJs app. Then do npm start for the Angular App and node index.js for the Node API
